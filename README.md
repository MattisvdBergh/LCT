# LCT
R code to perform Latent Class Tree Modelling with R and Latent GOLD

A function for dichotomous, continuous and longitudonal (growth) data, each function with a self-explanatory name.
There are also two functions to plot the results (so far only for dichotomous and longitudinal data).

The main arguments consist of
  dataDir = the directory for the data
  LG = the directory of LG 5.1
  LGS = the directory of the LG syntax
